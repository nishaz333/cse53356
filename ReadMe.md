# Questions
### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Implementing Angular JS was relatively easy because I have experience with javascript. Also, as this was covered in project 1, it was pretty easy to figure out and understand the implementation. So, learning and implementing Angular JS was simple.

Along with this, implementation of Node JS was also easy because of project 1 and therefore, there was time to further understand the concepts of node JS.
### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Uploading on heroku was difficult because I tried using few new things like ES6 code in node JS which heroku server does not accept and due to few links available on the internet, figuring out the errors was a task.
### If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
One of the biggest concern will be less control of the application while using heroku server. Along with this, security and speed are other big concerns.
